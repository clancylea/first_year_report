In order to process visual input from frame based imaging devices on a spiking 
neural network (SNN) a transformation is needed. The most common way is to 
simply encode using Poisson spiking with a rate that is proportional to pixel
intensity. This is not entirely accurate as cells in the retina react to changes
in intensity\cite{webvision} and perform other computation before emitting 
actual spikes. One of the most accurate retinal models was
developed by \citeauthor{virtual-retina} in \cite{virtual-retina}. A special
category is hardware based bio-inspired retinas. First reported on 
\cite{carver-mead}. New devices have been developed and reported in
\cite{aer-retina-bernabe, dvs-zurich}, this are splendid real-time, low-powered,
high-dynamic-range event-based cameras; though they have limited availability.

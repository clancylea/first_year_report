Part of the work carried during this year will be published as a paper on a 
\textbf{Frontiers in Neuroscience} journal in a special issue \emph{Benchmarks 
and Challenges for Neuromorphic Engineering}. The article will present the MNIST
database encoded using different types of spike codes and propose it as a
standard way of testing learning and recognition tasks.

<DETAILED_COMMENTS>
While the paper gives an excellent overview it is not quite clear what the autho is going to contribute.
The paper was very well written, the only minor critiqu points are:
-Explain why the proposed coding optimizations cant be done automatically by the compiler
-Try to graphicall illustrate the tiled convolution, while understandable, this would make it easier to understand.
-Remove the Still work in progress bits
-add a contribution, what are YOU going to conrtibute section
-Explain why picture b and c look so similar in figure 4

Obtained further knowledge about basic anatomy of the eye from 
a functional approach. Importance of mutual inhibition to enable 
high efficiency computing in the brain and robustness of neural 
structure. 

Real-time, although with low temporal resolution, is achievable 
with common GPU and the right combination of mathematics and 
engineering. Memory reads and writes in a GPU is extremely important;
it might be one of the biggest constraints of the presented algorithms.

We established a timing mechanism to emit spikes from a rank-ordered
source. Possible solutions for a faster mutual inhibition algorithm 
might be to do it in-line as we send spikes to neuromorphic hardware; 
or let the neural simulation deal with mutual inhibition.

To reduce the power consumption/hardware requirements for mobile applications 
the best way to go might be change the resolution so not all image is 
perceived in high resolution.

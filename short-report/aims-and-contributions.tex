This research aims to develop computer vision algorithms using SpiNNaker. This 
is to be achieved by modelling biological vision, using spiking neural networks,
on SpiNNaker. Several stages of vision would need modelling and/or 
implementation, the latter has been the goal for this year's work.
We hypothesize that a better understanding of vision in biology will lead to 
a unified computer vision framework. Using neural networks should translate in 
gaining an insight to the meaning of elements in a scene and, thus, a relation
between different images of the same scenario.

Bio-inspired vision algorithms using SpiNNaker hardware could be used on 
robotics, security or transportation applications. The research on learning and 
classification could lead into a theory of learning and memory in the brain.

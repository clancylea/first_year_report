Work on video conversion into spike trains is still ongoing. An FPGA-based solution is being studied, which could lead to a commercial product.

Studies of online learning with spike-time encoding are barely starting to appear, this is the foundation of our work so it will be researched extensively.

Hierarchical deep neural networks are the state-of-the-art in image recognition, understanding the relationship between them and a spiking equivalent is an interesting topic.

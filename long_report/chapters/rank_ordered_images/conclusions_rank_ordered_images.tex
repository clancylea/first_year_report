The retina may be seen as a tiny brain that compresses visual input, in that sense it's a very complex organ. Emulating its behaviour is a hard task for general purpose or graphics oriented hardware. The algorithms presented in this section provide a rank-order encoding to video sources. The foveal pit model is able to produce 12 frames per second, and fully encodes the image. The DVS emulator senses spacial and temporal contrast changes in the image and marks them as an event. 

The source code (written in Python and OpenCL) for the foveal-pit model~\cite{focal-code} and the DVS emulator~\cite{pydvs-code} can be found in an online repository.

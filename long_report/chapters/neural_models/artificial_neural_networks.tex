First modelled as an on-off threshold gate, perceptron

Multi-layered networks and feedback, Hebbian learning

Spiking neural networks, third gen, include time as a factor, more accurate, more powerful mathematical properties, 

learning studied using Hebbian back-prop, stdp, bcm

still work to be done on time-based learning

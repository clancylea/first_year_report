The brain is an amazing organ, responsible for a broad range of tasks from allowing an animal to hunt to human culture. Simulating the brain or even a single task the brain does in a biologically plausible way is still subject of active research. For \emph{fast} vision tasks the combination of spiking neural networks using temporal codes looks like the optimal path to follow. Izhikevich's simple model of spiking neurons seems appropriate for its computation-efficiency to biological-fidelity ratio.

%\section{The brain}
The \textbf{brain} is an exquisite piece of evidence for energy-efficient biological computation; the result of millions of years of an evolutionary process. It's been subject of multiple studies and, yet, we are barely getting to know it. The human brain consists of around $10^{12}$ \emph{neurons} which are interconnected through about $10^{15}$ special structures known as \emph{synapses}.
%It can perform the most diverse activities, from bird spotting to mathematics to art. All of this with about 20 watts of energy spread across many small computational units called \emph{neurons}.

Vision is probably the greatest sensory input the brain has, it allows us to perceive a vastly diverse set of phenomenons. From enjoying a baby smile or checking if our meals are well cooked to avoiding traffic accidents or enjoying a film, it all happens thanks to the amazing visual processing capabilities of the brain. Furthermore, this kind of input has given humans the possibility of culture through reading and writing, to the point that we are now starting to unravel the secret of how the brain works; in a sense, a brain trying to study itself.

What is known as vision can be thought of as a set of tasks that have been observed in humans and other animals, such as object detection and recognition, image segmentation or depth perception, to name a few. A complex but crucial aspect of vision is the ability to create mental maps of our current or past locations. This may have been developed as a survival strategy that allows animals to reach known food or water resources. Creating a system that mimics this extraordinary capacity is still an open research problem. Since it's been observed that our nervous system is able to recreate a mental representation of  environments, taking inspiration from nature is a good strategy to follow. The goal of this project is to create a bio-inspired three-dimensional (3D) environment reconstruction system based on spiking neural networks (SNN). An additional benefit of this research is to acquire further knowledge of how the brain gains understanding and interprets the world through vision. Some applications to such a system are, mapping hazardous zones (e.g. nuclear power plants, war zones, active volcanoes), security (e.g. traffic camera analysis) or self or assisted guided vehicles (e.g. cars, drones, aeroplanes).

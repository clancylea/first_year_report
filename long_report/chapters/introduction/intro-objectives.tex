3D environment reconstruction is a very active field of research.
Advances in depth perception (KINECT) have made real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) a possibility.
One way of achieving is to use high-performance GPUs and solve the problem using raw power.
Another is to use a mix of KINECT and RETINA, not fully neural???
We propose using an exclusively neural networks approach using SpiNNaker hardware.

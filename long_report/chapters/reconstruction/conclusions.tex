The reconstruction problem has been solved through techniques like structure from motion or simultaneous localization and mapping. Most of these approaches require high-performance hardware and consume large quantities of electrical power to deliver real-time or near real-time results. A spiking neural networks solution would reduce this consumption due to sparse encoding of visual features and neuromorphic hardware. Another benefit of solving this problem with SNN is that it would require to integrate multiple networks in a larger ensemble, which might lead to an understanding of biological vision.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few attempts to use solely a neural networks approach, let alone using SNN. The milestones set for this project are hard tasks and some have recently been started to be researched. All in all, this is a very interesting problem from which many research opportunities will emerge.

The problem of environment reconstruction implies taking a collection of sensed data and transforming it into a representation of the scenes the data was taken from (Figure~\ref{fig:slam:example}). This work will focus in getting a three-dimensional reconstruction from sensor data. The most studied types of sensed data are depth (e.g. laser radar, sonar) and visual (e.g. photography, video). For our research the main input will be visual, either from video sources converted into spikes or a DVS.

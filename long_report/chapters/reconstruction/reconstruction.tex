Environment reconstruction has been receiving a lot of attention from research  community, specially with things like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Typically performed using cameras


\section{Simultaneous localization and mapping}

Examples of SLAM

High performance hardware and/or exotic sensors (laser/kinect-like)

Mix of Kinect + DVS

Rat neuro based SLAM



\section{Conclusions}

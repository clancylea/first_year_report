I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Steve Furber for accepting me as one of his PhD students. 
I would also like to thank the Secretariat of Public education (SEP) and the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) for funding my studies. 
My gratitude goes to everyone from the Advanced Processor Technologies (APT) group for their help and support.

To my friends, family and my lovely wife, who have always supported me and have been my strength throughout the years, the greatest thanks.

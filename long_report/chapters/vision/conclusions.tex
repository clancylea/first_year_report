A complete model the visual cortex remains an open research question. Though many neural networks and computer vision models account for single visual functions, a unified solution has not been developed. Since environment reconstruction makes use of many of these functions, this research could lead to contributions to a general theory of vision. 

A hierarchical neural networks approach promises to have better results. The training of deep spiking neural networks is still in early stages of research, which brings another opportunity for contributions to neuroscience. Recurrent neural networks could provide the necessary framework to solve the training problem.

Traditionally cameras have been used as they work similar to the first stage of the eye.

Recently dynamic vision sensor

They work in a way that more resembles the retina, event based

Still need development, resolution is low, they do not perform multiple-scale
convolution, expensive

A mix of both can be a great tool for researchers and commercial applications see Chp \ref{chp:img2spk}

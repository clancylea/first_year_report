Vision is one of the most important senses for animals; humans use it extensively for all kinds of tasks. Hunting, assessing danger, reading, driving, drawing, predicting rain from grey clouds, etc., these are all tasks that involve \emph{seeing}. There is a vast collection of knowledge about the components of vision (primates in particular), though a unification (or the answer to \emph{How do we see?}) has not yet been achieved.

Artificial neural networks have been used to emulate some behaviours of the human visual system. One of the most successful is image recognition, in particular using deep networks~\cite{deep-nets-hinton2006fast,krizhevsky2012imagenet}. Seminal computer vision research has also been based on the functional characteristics of biological vision~\cite{lowe1999object,lowe2004distinctive,alahi2012freak}. The success of bio-inspired research in computer vision is the inspiration for studying the visual pathway in animals (primates in particular) and to create a system that would solve the SLAM problem.

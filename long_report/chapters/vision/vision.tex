Vision is one of the most important senses for animals; humans use it extensively for all kinds of tasks. Hunting, assessing danger, reading, driving, drawing, predicting rain from grey clouds, etc., these are all tasks that involve \emph{seeing}. 

There is a vast collection of knowledge about the components of vision, though a unified theory of vision (or the answer to \emph{How do we see?}) has not yet been achieved.

Vision starts at the eye, which transforms electromagnetic radiation that assembles an image, into voltage pulses that our brain may interpret. This encoded images are sent to the posterior region of the brain through the optic nerves. The cortex then performs many computations that result in our ability to see.

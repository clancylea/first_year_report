@article{dynamical-systems-Izhikevich2007,
  abstract = {In order to model neuronal behavior or to interpret the results of modeling studies, neuroscientists must call upon methods of nonlinear dynamics. This book offers an introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems theory for researchers and graduate students in neuroscience. It also provides an overview of neuroscience for mathematicians who want to learn the basic facts of electrophysiology.Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience presents a systematic study of the relationship of electrophysiology, nonlinear dynamics, and computational properties of neurons. It emphasizes that information processing in the brain depends not only on the electrophysiological properties of neurons but also on their dynamical properties. The book introduces dynamical systems, starting with one- and two-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley-type models and continuing to a description of bursting systems. Each chapter proceeds from the simple to the complex, and provides sample problems at the end. The book explains all necessary mathematical concepts using geometrical intuition; it includes many figures and few equations, making it especially suitable for non-mathematicians. Each concept is presented in terms of both neuroscience and mathematics, providing a link between the two disciplines. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory is at the core of computational neuroscience research, but it is not a standard part of the graduate neuroscience curriculum—or taught by math or physics department in a way that is suitable for students of biology. This book offers neuroscience students and researchers a comprehensive account of concepts and methods increasingly used in computational neuroscience.An additional chapter on synchronization, with more advanced material, can be found at the author's website, www.izhikevich.com.},

@article{Cessac2010,
  abstract = {In the present overview, our wish is to demystify some aspects of coding with spike-timing, through a simple review of well-understood technical facts regarding spike coding. Our goal is a better understanding of the extent to which computing and modeling with spiking neuron networks might be biologically plausible and computationally efficient. We intentionally restrict ourselves to a deterministic implementation of spiking neuron networks and we consider that the dynamics of a network is defined by a non-stochastic mapping. By staying in this rather simple framework, we are able to propose results, formula and concrete numerical values, on several topics: (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking neuron networks parameter adjustment. Beside an argued review of several facts and issues about neural coding by spikes, we propose new results, such as a numerical evaluation of the most critical temporal variables that schedule the progress of realistic spike trains. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for biological simulation or computational purpose, it is important to take into account the indisputable facts here unfolded. This precaution could prevent one from implementing mechanisms that would be meaningless relative to obvious time constraints, or from artificially introducing spikes when continuous calculations would be sufficient and more simple. It is also pointed out that implementing a large-scale spiking neuron network is finally a simple task. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{third-gen-nn-Maass1997,
  abstract = {The computational power of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other neural network models based on McCulloch Pitts neurons (i.e., threshold gates), respectively, sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.},
